The [[plugins/mdwn]] plugin can use one of several markdown implementations depending on some settings and what's available in the (Perl) environment.

It would be good to have a way to report exactly which version ended up being chosen for a given invocation. Either as a verbose log message, or
by setting a variable that could be echoed into content by another command. *— [[Jon]], 2021-11-08*.

> +1 && LGTM, but i'm not sure that needs gettext since it's debugging? -- [[anarcat]]

>> Thank you. RE gettext, I think there's value in localizing even debug messages. But
>> I might have not approached it ideally, I did wonder whether instead of `gettext("mdwn: using Text::Markdown::markdown")`
>> I should have done something like `"mdwn: ".gettext("using ")."Text::Markdown::markdown"`.
>> I bow to the superior gettext knowledge of just about anyone. *— [[Jon]], 2021-11-10*
