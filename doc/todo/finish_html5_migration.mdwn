We should get rid of the html5 config option, remove all the branching around
it in the templates and unconditionally use the semantic container elements.
The advantages are twofold: users will get the semantic containers by default
and working with ikiwiki's templates will be greatly simplified.

In 490a1eca (2014), we moved to always generating HTML (5) ([[cf|todo/generate_HTML5_by_default]])
and the `html5` config option was re-purposed to control whether
the template used newer HTML elements such as `section`, `footer`,
etc. The option remained default to off, because ten years ago,
a significant fraction of web users were using MSIE versions (≤ 8) that
didn't support them.

As of 2024, [caniuse report](https://caniuse.com/usage-table) IE8 usage at
0.02%. There are no statistically signifiant browsers in use that do not
support the elements we gate behind the `html5` config option.
([cf](https://caniuse.com/html5semantic))

We should take the following steps

1. default `html5` config option to true. This would not
   affect existing installations which have a fully-populated configuration
   file, which will contain either the user's preference or the previous
   default of 0. The exception is if the user has deleted the `html5` key
   from the config file which is unlikely.

2. Print a warning that the `html5` configuration option is deprecated if it is
   set to 0, explaining that it will be removed in a future release. (Possibly
   pointing at this page).

3. Remove the template branching `<TMPL_IF HTML5>`, replacing it with the
   true branch

4. Remove the config option.

I think steps 1 and 2 could take place in the same release.
Steps 1/2 and 3/4 should take place in different releases.
Steps 3 and 4 should happen in the same release.
