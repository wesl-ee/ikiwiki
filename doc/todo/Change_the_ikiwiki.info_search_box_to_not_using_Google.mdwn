The search box on ikiwiki uses Google to look for documentation. Unfortunately to use the result page one have to accept Google terms of use, which may be annoying (since it is full of tracker and a real privacy nightmare).

Would it be possible to change the default behavior to use another search engine more privacy friendly such as https://duckduckgo.com or https://qwant.com.

With both engines adding the "site:ikiwiki.info" string to the search terms limit results to these present on ikiwiki.info.
