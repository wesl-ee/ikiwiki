Modern OSes and browsers can now report a user's preference for a "dark mode"
setting. See <https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/>
for some background on technical specifics.

The default IkiWiki anti-theme leaves most styling decisions up to the browser.
Nevertheless, the anti-theme will always be rendered as Light, regardless of a
user's preference for dark-mode, as a site's css needs to explicitly indicate
that it *can* support dark-mode in order for it to be available.

IkiWiki's anti-theme almost entirely supports dark-mode out of the box by virtue
of delegating the style decisions to browser defaults. We should add the minimum
required CSS to let it be enabled.

(The only example of default theme which does not appear to look good in dark
mode, in my testing, is the styling around [[RecentChanges]].)

> [[reviewed]]: more work is needed before this should be considered. For the
