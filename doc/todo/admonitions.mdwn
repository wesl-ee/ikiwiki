In the [MoinMoin wiki][], there is this neat little hack called
[Admonitions][] that basically create a `<div>` block with a specific
style out of a certain section of the text.

I couldn't find a way to do this easily in Ikiwiki. On the one hand,
there is no easy way to create div blocks with arbitrary styles (which
is basically what MoinMoin admonitions are). On the other hand, there
are no neat little logos in stylesheets like there are in Moinmoin
either.

It would be great to see this implemented in Ikiwiki. Now, I know I
can make a `<div>` myself, but I am not sure we should encourage users
to inject arbitrary HTML in ikiwiki pages. And even then, we should
add adminition CSS classes to make that easier to use.

Ideally, Ikiwiki would support Pandoc or Github-style fenced blocks
and could abuse those to allow arbitrary styles (and markup!) to kick
in. The [[ikiwiki/directive/format]] directive could also be used, I
guess, but I dislike how it requires all those brackets and quotes and
bangs and all...

Update: I have made a [[plugins/contrib/admonition]] plugin for this
purpose, as a patch. Hopefully it will be mergeable here? Here's a
screenshot of what the help page would look like, to give you an idea
of the results:

I like the idea of admonitions. I've done something vaguely similar on my own site ([e.g.](https://jmtd.net/film/blade_runner/)), but I just
use `\[[!template` and put up with the verbosity.I like that `\[[!tip` is shorter than `\[[!template id=…`. If
I was being a total purist I'd argue that the correct change would be to make a syntax shortcut
for the template syntax, since functionally that's what `tip` is doing, and include the
admonition styles in either `style.css` or in every shipped theme. But I'm more of a pragmatist
and your current plugin actually exists and IkiWiki is starving for contributors (IMHO)
so I encourage maintainers to merge it. I will probably merge it into [opinionated ikiwiki](https://jmtd.net/log/opinionated_ikiwiki/)
in either case (which will at least mean there'll be another avenue for people to check it out)  *— [[Jon]], 2020-08-07*

I keep on hoping all patches get merged and that i don't need to (more officially) fork `master`, but it seems that's where I need to go myself... In the meantime you can see the list of patches I maintain in [[users/anarcat]] and [my maintenance log](https://anarc.at/services/wiki/). I hope that helps! -- [[anarcat]]

> > Turns out I found the time. I merged all my active branches in the `master` branch on gitlab. not sure what you'd compare it against, but there, it's done. :) [[anarcat]]

>>> Thanks for that! I'll try to explain what I meant in terms of an example. your `admonitions` is  a series of commits that ultimately sit on top of

>>>> I have rebased all my current branches onto `debian/3.20190228-1` because that's what I'm patching in production, and I have updated my `master` branch on GitLab to follow that. The branches are admonitions, [bootstrap-plugin](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/contrib/bootstrap), [toc-skip](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/allow_toc_to_skip_entries), [page-template-variable](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/include_page_variable_in_base_templates), [js-newline](https://ikiwiki.info/bugs/javascript_resources_placed_after_html_tag/), [i18n-headinganchors](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/contrib/i18nheadinganchors), [dev/git-annex-support](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/git-annex_support/), and [geo-scheme](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/add_geo_uri_scheme/). Phew. Is that what you needed? It's still kind of a mess, but it should make it easier for you to review... --[[anarcat]]

I've finally started playing around with this plugin. I think the default CSS needs
tweaking. I see "warning" has `padding` to try to account for the icon size, but 
the other admonitions do not. Perhaps they need to inherit some style from a common
class? Either way, the padding does not seem to work. This is a fresh ikiwiki with
the actiontab theme enabled:

> I had kind of given up on this guy here, to be honest, but if you want to see a working version, you can look at [my sandbox](https://anarc.at/sandbox/). Obviously, the CSS does need more tweaking, but it seems it's not my specialty. ;) -- [[anarcat]]

>> It turned out to be a simple fix, a missing semicolon. [patch here](https://github.com/jmtd/ikiwiki/commit/3e31200ed258ba1f7ab1652d6bc2d035a9e5c990). The rest of that branch is just your admonitions branch rebased onto `3.20200202.3`. *—[[Jon]], 2021-02-18*

>>> Interesting. That was of course, a missing semicolon, not sure how I missed that. I cherry-picked your patch, but I wonder why I wasn't seeing the problem on my end... Maybe I had other padding that was covering for this... Thanks, in any case! :) -- [[anarcat]]
