Here's how to get ikiwiki in source or prepackaged form. See [[setup]] for
how to use it, and be sure to add your wiki to [[IkiwikiUsers]] if you use
ikiwiki.

## source

Ikiwiki is developed in a [[git_repository|git]].

The best place to download a tarball of the latest release is from 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>.

Manual installation steps and requirements are listed on the [[install]] page.

## Debian / Ubuntu packages

To install with [apt](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_basic_package_management_operations), if using Debian or Ubuntu:

        apt-get install ikiwiki

Or download the deb from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/ikiwiki>.

## RPM packages

Fedora versions 8 and newer have RPMs of ikiwiki available.

Ikiwiki's source includes a RPM spec file, which you can use to build your
own RPM.

## BSD ports

NetBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, and many other platforms:
[pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/) has an [ikiwiki package](http://pkgsrc.se/www/ikiwiki).
`make install` to build from source, or on platforms with binary packages available:

        pkg_add ikiwiki

FreeBSD has ikiwiki in its
[ports collection](http://www.freshports.org/www/ikiwiki/):

        pkg install -U ikiwiki

## Other packages

Gentoo has an [ebuild](http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144453) in its bug database. 

The [openSUSE Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=ikiwiki) has packages for openSUSE

A [PKGBUILD for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ikiwiki/) is in the AUR.

A basic [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) Tap is available at <https://github.com/naosnz/homebrew-ikiwiki> ([[discussion|forum/Can someone add Ikiwiki in Homebrew?]])
