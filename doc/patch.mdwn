Since we have enough people working on ikiwiki to be dangerous, or at least
to duplicate work without coordination, here's a queue of suggested patches.

If you post a patch to the [[todo]] or [[bugs]] list, or elsewhere,
once it's ready to be applied, add a 'patch' tag so it will show up here.

If your patch is non-trivial and might need several iterations to get
right, or you'd just like to make it easy for [[Joey]] to apply it,
please consider publishing a [[git]] [[branch|branches]].

Patches that have been reviewed and need changes before they are merged
are listed separately, on the [[reviewed]] list.

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(patch) and !link(bugs/done) and
!link(todo/done) and !link(reviewed) and !*/Discussion" rootpage="todo" archive="yes"]]
